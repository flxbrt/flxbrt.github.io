				<p>
					The chair of Space Mobility and Propulsion launched the ASCENT project in 2024. ASCENT is 
					a free-flying, vertical-takeoff, vertical landing platform 
					propelled by a ~3kN hot gas propulsion system. ASCENT aims to bridge the gap between 
					academic research and technology development. In particular, we want to demonstrate our
					fault-tolerant control strategies on a fully integrated propulsive landing vehicle.  
					<br> <br>
					An overview of technical development steps and highlights follows below.

					<h3>System Design</h3>
					<p>
						ASCENT was initiated on a blank sheet of paper. I developed the system architecture using a model-based 
						design approach to handle the strong coupling between propulsion, structure, tanks, avionics, and control.
						<br> <br>
						To support rapid iteration under uncertainty, I implemented <a href="https://github.com/flxbrt/HopIt" 
						class="active" target="_blank">HopIt</a> a Python-based design framework 
						that computes feasible system configurations from high-level mission parameters. The tool resolves the 
						implicit coupling between subsystems through fixed-point iteration and Newton-type solvers and enables early-stage sensitivity analyses.
						<br> <br>
						This approach revealed the dominant design levers driving system mass and directly informed component-level 
						requirements. Parts of this methodology and its results have been published.

					<h3>Thermal Constraints</h3>
					<p> 
						Thermal feasibility is a key boundary condition for the ASCENT propulsion system, with combustion temperatures
						exceeding 3000K. In order to evaluate feasible cooling options, I implemented <a href="https://github.com/flxbrt/THERMAT" 
						class="active" target="_blank">THERMAT</a>, a 1D flow and wall heat transfer 
						solver that includes regenerative cooling for variable cooling geometries. With the help of THERMAT we were able to
						identify regenerative cooling with the fuel (Ethanol) as a feasible option to ensure thermal integrity of the thrust chamber. 
						Hence, with the help of THERMAT I was able to constrain the feasible oxidizer to fuel ratio while also capturing
						requirements regarding local coolant heat transfer peaks to avoid thermal hot spots in certain sections of the thrust chamber. 
						This way THERMAT supports both system-level trade studies and detailed thrust-chamber design

					<h3>GNC Demonstrator</h3>
					<p> 
						To de-risk flight control development, we developed the eHopper together with <a href="https://warr.de/de/" 
						class="active" target="_blank">WARR</a>, a low-cost, propeller-driven subscale 
						demonstrator. Its dynamics are scaled to ASCENT using Buckingham-Pi similarity, enabling meaningful controller validation.
						<br> <br>
						More importantly, the eHopper serves as a testbed for the full GNC hardware and software stack later deployed on ASCENT. 
						Operating at significantly lower cost and risk, it allows rapid iteration and debugging.
						<br> <br>
						The avionics stack centers around a Raspberry Pi 5 companion computer and a Pixhawk for state estimation and actuator interfacing.

					<h3>Flight Control</h3>
					<p> 
						The ASCENT Hopper is an underactuated system with dynamically coupled longitudinal and rotary states. The dynamics can be 
						thought of as an inverted pendulum with two rotary degrees of freedom, rendering the open loop dynamics naturally unstable. 
						<br> <br>
						In order to achieve agile flight trajectories while ensuring stable tracking of the trajecory and hover flight, we 
						decompose the problem into a motion planning step and subsequent trajectory tracking. The planner formulates trajectory 
						generation as a nonlinear optimization problem in CasADi, exploiting differential flatness while respecting physical limitations of the Hopper.
						<br> <br>
						The resulting trajectories are tracked by a dedicated feedback controller (QP-based MPC). The development was mainly carried out by two students
						under the lead supervision of <a href="https://jonarriza96.github.io/" class="active" target="_blank">Jon Arrizabalaga</a> and co-supervised by me.

					<h3>Thrust Vector Control System</h3>
					<p> 
						The thrust vector control system translates guidance commands into physical thrust deflections. A central bearing enables two rotational 
						degrees of freedom, actuated by two orthogonal linear actuators.
						<br> <br>
						The system achieves full deflection within 0.5 s, enabling agile maneuvers and stable hover flight.

					<h3>Throttling Valves</h3>
					<p> 
						Precise trajectory tracking requires control over both thrust direction and magnitude. Thrust is regulated 
						via independently actuated throttling valves in the oxidizer and fuel feed lines, allowing simultaneous 
						thrust modulation and mixture-ratio control.
						<br> <br>
						As no suitable off-the-shelf solution existed, manually operated valves were augmented with BLDC motors to 
						achieve the required remote control authority bandwidth.

					<h3>Injector</h3>
					<p> 
						Initial trajectory and system design studies indicated a required thrust range of 40–100%. A pintle injector was selected due to its 
						stable operation over a wide throttling range.
						<br> <br>
						I designed the injector based on a preliminary student developed iteration. <!--using the PINJEC Python tool, which allows tuning of 
						injection conditions and sensitivity analysis with respect 
						to manufacturing tolerances -> nicht public--> To ensure stable operation across the desired operational envelope,
						the design is optimized for robustness against mass-flow deviations resulting from manufacturing tolerances.
						<br> <br>
						Manufacturing is ongoing, with cold-flow testing planned for April 2026.

					<h3>Propulsion Test Bench</h3>
					<p> 
						Prior to integration, the propulsion system is characterized on a dedicated cryogenic bi-liquid test bench. 
						The facility supports thrust levels up to 4 kN and tank pressures up to 80 bar.
						<br> <br>
						I designed the test bench structure, fluid system, and instrumentation layout. It enables cold-flow, 
						hot-fire, throttling, and thrust-vectoring experiments. Assembly and commissioning are currently ongoing, supported by our technical staff.

				<h4>Design & Demonstration</h4>
				<p>
                    Starting on a blank sheet of paper, our chair are developing 
					the ASCENT platform to demonstrate our research does 
					not only work on paper and in simulations, but in flight 
					/ on real hardware!.

				<h4>Educating & Guiding</h4>
				<p>
                    Being responsible for the project management and 
					technical development of the ASCENT project gives 
					me the opportunity to guide a team of great students. 
                </p>

			<div class="hero-highlight">
				<h4>Being Curious</h4>
				<p>
                    I'd like to explore and learn new things. 
					This is true for methods that allow me to 
					solve problems in smart ways, but also applications. 
					Hence, I am very grateful that I had the chance to 
					join the MECO Team in Leuven in 2025, where I was 
					working in robotics instead of rocketry! The ASCENT 
					project allows me to look into heat transfer and other aspects. 
                </p>
