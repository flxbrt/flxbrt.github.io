					The chair of Space Mobility and Propulsion launched the ASCENT project in 2024. ASCENT is 
					a free-flying, vertical-takeoff, vertical landing platform 
					propelled by a ~3kN hot gas propulsion system. ASCENT aims to bridge the gap between 
					academic and applied research and technology development. In particular, we want to demonstrate our
					fault tolerant control strategies on a fully integrated propulsive landing vehicle.

					<h3>System Design</h3>
					<p>
						I started this project on a blank sheet of paper. One of the challenges I faced during this project is 
						uncertainty within the design process. 
						Starting this project on a blank-sheet of paper gave me the opportunity to develop the design process freely. 
						I choose to implement a model-based system design tool in Python. I did so because I was expecting many changes and 
						small adaptions to happen during the lifetime of the project, because of initial assumptions made that need to be 
						monitored and continously updated or potentially design changes that need to be made. Implementing a tool that 
						automatically computes a feasible overall system design, accounting for all relevant subsystems - such as propulsion, 
						tanks, structure, avionics etc. - is very helpful. Further, what such as tool allows is run sensitivity studies 
						in the early phase. This helps to identify the big levers that determine the overall system mass. 
						This idea led to the HopIt tool. I implements a model-based design routine. Given a set of input configuration parameters,
						such as the intended flight-time, propellant of choice, oxidizer fuel ratio etc. it computes the most relevant system
						sepcifications, such as 
						Since all subsystems are interrelated (for instance a heavier tank, requires an engine with more thrust, wich requires 
						more propellant which in turn will require larger and more heavy tanks), this constitues an implicit problem. I solve this in 
						two different ways: Either, via a fixed point iteration, if external tools such as cantera or coolprop have to called
						during the iterative solve or via a newton type root finding method. 
						Overall, this tool helpe me to better understand, which design parameters are most relevant
						to minimize overall system mass and to derive requirements for the subsequent component development process. 					
						This design approach alongside with some insights into the results went into a publication. 
						The HopIt tool allowed me to compare different engines cycles and propellant combinations and find a design that minimizes system
						mass while understanding the main sensitivities.

					<h3>Thermal Constraints</h3>
					<p> 
						A central boundary condition for the system design is the feasible oxidizer-to-fuel ratio. Combustion temperatures
						within the combustion chamber of the rocket engine can be as high 3000K or more, far above the melting point
						of typical alloys. To avoid using high-temperature and very expensive special allows, I decided to implement
						regenerative cooling. Regenerative cooling usually uses one of the propellants - in our case the fuel - 
						and guides this propellant through the wall of the combustion chamber, thereby acting as a heat exchanger, pickung 
						up heat and avoiding that the combustion chamber melts. However there are two limits. For one, the collant must provide
						a sufficient heat capacity to pick up the heat entering the combustion chamber wall, which in turn depends on 
						the geometry of the thrust chamber and the combustion conditions. Also, the locally the wall temperature varies a lot
						since the local heat transfer varies a lot, mostly depending on the hot gas velocity profile within the combustion chamber.
						In order to find the feasible oxidizer-to-fuel ratio while accounting for all those aspects I implemented the THERMAT tool. 
						It computes the wall and coolant temperature along the axial coordinate of the thrust chamber and therefore significantly helps me 
						in the system and thrust chamber component design.

					<h3>GNC Demonstrator</h3>
					<p> 
						Operating the ASCENT Hopper requires a powerful, modular and reliable GNC avionics stack. The eHopper 
						is the propeller driven low-cost subscale answer to that. It weighs around 1.2kg and is designed to mimic 
						the dynamic behaviour of ASCENT based on Buckingham-Pi theory. Ever more important than that, it allows us to 
						test and reiterate the GNC Hardware and Software stack that will later be used on the ASCENT Hopper. 
						Operation of the eHopper is a lot less ressource intensive and less safety critical. Hence buggs can be fixed
						here a lot more easy. 
						The hardware stack is centered around a Pi5 acting as companion and a Pixhawk acting as state estimation device 
						and interface to all actors and sensors.

					<h3>Flight Control</h3>
				
					<p> 
						The Hopper can be thought of as an inverted pendulum that need to be stabilized, but in two rotational degrees at once. 
						Further, a rotary motion induces a longitudional motion, shoing the couling of its states. Hence, any trjeactory needs to be
						well planned in order to stabilize the Hopper while reaching the goal given the coupling of the states and the underactuation 
						of the system. We decided to break this problen into two pieces: A motion planning problem and a tracking problem. 
						The motion planning problem formulates the trajectory generation as an NLP (implemented in CasADi), thereby taking into account the physical limits
						of the system. Further, it implements the dynamics in a differentially flat way. 
						A special thanks goes to <a href="https://jonarriza96.github.io/" 
						class="active">Jon Arrizabalaga</a>. He was the lead supervisor for the students developing the planner and 
						tracker.

					<h3>Thrust Vector Control System</h3>
					<p> 
						The flight control algorithm provides the logic to make the ASCENT Hopper fly trajectories, i.e. it computes reference thrust commmands,
						the thrust vector control system adjusts the thrust vector accordingly. It features a central bearing which allows the required 
						two degrees of freedom. Two linear actors are working perpedicular to each other to gimbal the engine in less than 0.5s between the 
						maximum deflection positions. This allows the Hopper to fly agile trajectories and stabilize constant hover flights.

					<h3>Throttling Valves</h3>
					<p> 
						Not only the thrust vector needs to be adjusted but also the thrust magnitude, to allow for precise
						trajcetory tracking and soft touchdown. The thrust of a rocket engine is determined by the mass flow that
						enters the main combustion chamber. We decided to use throttling valves in the main feed lines to regulate
						the propellant flows independently. This allows to adjust the thrust magnitude, while regulating the oxidizer to fuel
						ratio to stay within the safe and feasible operational envelope of the engine. 
						Commercial of the shelf electronically controlled regulating valves were not available for this application. 
						Hence we decided to buy manually operated regulating valves and augment them by a BLDC motor, to give them the control
						authority at the bandwidth required. The valves will arrive soon and will subsequeently be commishioned.

					<h3>Injector</h3>
					<p> 
						The system analysed showed that a thrust from 40 - 100% would be required to fly the anticipated trajectories. 
						The Pintle injector is well known to work reliably and with considerable high combustion efficiency, even at 
						low load points. Based on a preliminary design developed in a student thesis, I designed the pintle injector 
						and the thrust chamber baseed on the PINJEC Python tool, developed by me. The tool allows to tune injection conditions
						and analyse the impact of manufacturing deviations on the mass flow distribution upon injection. The Pintle design 
						is optimzed to minimize the impact of manufacturing deviations. 
						The injector is currently being manufactured and will be cold flow tested towards April 2026.

					<h3>Propulsion Test Bench</h3>
					<p> 
						Thourough characterisation of the rocket engine is required before it can be integrated into the ASCENT Hopper. 
						This includes cold flow tests for the flow characterisic evaluation of the injector, going to hot-fire test, 
						and movind on to throttling and thrust vector control tests. All these capabilities are provided by the croygenic, 
						bi-liquid propulsion test bench supporting thrusts of up to 4kN and pressure of up to 80bar in the run tanks. I 
						designed the test bench structure, fluid system and selected the required probes. The assembly and commissioinng is ongoing. 
						Many thanks goes to our technician who is supporting me with this efforts!

				<h4>Being Curious</h4>
				<p>
                    I'd like to explore and learn new things. 
					This is true for methods that allow me to 
					solve problems in smart ways, but also applications. 
					Hence, I am very grateful that I had the chance to 
					join the MECO Team in Leuven in 2025, where I was 
					working in robotics instead of rocketry! The ASCENT 
					project allows me to look into heat transfer and other aspects.
