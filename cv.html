							Research at the intersection of rocket propulsion and modern control methods, focusing on dynamic modeling, system identification, and experimental validation on real-world test benches. <br>
							Preliminary Title “Robust and agile control of rocket propulsion systems” <br>
							Autonomy is becoming ever more important for modern spaceflight and upcoming missions to remote locations. Hence, my PhD focuses on the intersection of rocketry and control, complemented by data-driven and learningbased techniques where they provide measurable benefit. In particular, I leverage modern control paradigms – such as MPC – to allow for more agile and more robust thrust control of rocket propulsion systems, with the goal of maintaining control authority over the system even in the event of faults. <br>
							Developing strong control theory is great, but it also must work in practice. This is why we launched the ASCENT project, with the goal of building a free-flying vertical take-off and vertical landing platform. The propulsion system of ASCENT will serve me as a test setup to verify my control research in 2026.

							My academic visit to Leuven allowed me to work on a very exciting and different control problem from my everyday life: the time-optimal motion of an overhead crane with collision avoidance, i.e. satisfying safety constraints. I implemented an Artificial Reference MPC (developed by a colleague in Leuven) for the nonlinear overhead crane dynamics and augmented the control policy with a higher-order control barrier function to ensure collision avoidance. This approach, together with the FATROP solver developed at MECO, allowed me to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control architecture in real-time through real-world experiments. Details will be available in the publication at CCTA 2026.

							MSc Thesis: “Design and commissioning of a test bench for water electrolysis propulsion systems for cubesats” <br><br>
							The first part of my Master Thesis focused on the design of a CubeSat 1N GH2/GO2 hot gas thruster with special consideration on the thermal management. Upon completion of the design process, the thruster was manufactured using SLM (3D printing). Further, I designed, procured and commissioned the test bench required to characterise the thruster, together with another student working on the LabView implementation of the control and measurement software.

							For the first part of my internship I focused on the classification and quantification of manufacturing errors within compressor blades. For that reason, I was in contact with the compressor blade supplier in Hungary. <br>
							Later on, I was using an in-house 2D CFD tool to assess the impact of the manufacturing errors on the aerodynamic performance of the compressor stage. Furthermore, I participated in the Erasmus+ Intercultural Competences course.

							BSc Thesis: “3D-CFD geometry- and flow field analysis of a centrifugal compressor database through correlation functions” <br><br>
							I analysed patterns within large CFD data bases (>2000 CFD runs) of centrifugal compressors. The data base was a result of a CFD-based design optimization of the centrifugal stage. I was implementing a Python tool that allows to compute correlations between changes in the flow field / geometry of the pump and performance metrics such as the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. This way I was able to identify patterns and sensitive regions in the flow field that are most relevant to the performance metrics considered.

							The Chair of Space Mobility and Propulsion at the Technical University of Munich is developing a Vertical-Take-off-
							Vertical-Landing Platform - called the Autonomous Control and Engine Technology (ASCENT) platform - propelled
							by a hot gas propulsion system. One challenge lies in the complexity of synthesizing feasible design candidates due
							to circular interdependencies between subsystems. A model-based design approach is proposed to overcome this issue.
							For this, relevant governing equations (for subsystems such as the thrust chamber, structure, or parts of the feeding
							system) are derived. They are subsequently brought into a root-finding problem structure, which is solved given different
							solver architectures. This methodology is utilized to address uncertainties present in the early design phase via
							sensitivity analysis based on a Monte-Carlo-like sampling approach. Among other findings, this analysis shows that the
							determination of pressure losses between the propellant tanks and the thrust chamber significantly impacts the mass of
							the entire system and should neither be under- nor over-predicted.

							human spaceflight activities and the associated reliability 
							demands motivate the authors to study strategies to improve 
							reliability of space vehicles from a control perspective. 
							A Model Predictive Controller and the Parameter Adaption 
							System Identification Algorithm are used to build a Fault 
							Tolerant Control Framework. The reference application case 
							is the cold gas-propelled Rocket Hopper operated by the 
							Chair of Space Mobility and Propulsion at TUM. Spontaneously 
							during constant Hover flight, a permanent, and partial loss 
							of thrust of 30% is injected. The Fault Tolerant Controller

The supervision includes continous mentoring, technical feedback, and guidance. This way I help students to derive requirements, structure their theses and solve open-ended research and engineering problems. This ensures functional deliverables upon completion of the thesis. Some of them are mentioned in the ASCENT project.
